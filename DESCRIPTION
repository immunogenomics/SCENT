Title: Single-Cell ENhancer Target (SCENT) gene mapping for single cell multimodal data 
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Saori Sakaue and Shakson Isaac
Maintainer: Shakson Isaac <shakson_isaac@g.harvard.edu>
Description: R package that contains functions for the SCENT algorithm. SCENT uses 
    single-cell multimodal data (e.g., 10X Multiome RNA/ATAC) and links 
    ATAC-seq peaks (putative enhancers) to their target genes by modeling association
    between chromatin accessibility and gene expression across individual single cells.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
